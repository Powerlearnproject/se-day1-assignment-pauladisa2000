Software Engineering Day1 Assignment:

Part 1: 

 Introduction to Software Engineering


* Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. 
Software engineers apply engineering principles and knowledge of programming languages to build software solutions for end users.


* Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1968: The first NATO Software Engineering Conference is held. * 1970s: A number of new methodologies are developed, 
including structured programming and object-oriented programming. * 1980s: The first computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools are released.

* List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

-Requirements: Understanding the users needs
-Design and prototype: Blueprint designs and prototype
-Software development: Code writing 
-Testing: Experimenting, debbuging and testing of codes
-Deployment: Making software solutions available for users
-Maintenance: Software supports and updates.


* Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

 In waterfall testing, testing is based on a fixed scope and requirements that are defined upfront and rarely change. In agile testing, 
testing is based on a dynamic scope and requirements that are constantly evolving 

* Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

-A software developer, responsible for designing, coding, testing, and deploying software applications using a variety of programming languages and technologies.
-A quality assurance engineer ensures that the software passes all checks before its release to the users. They oversee every phase of design, 
development, testing and delivery to verify if the product meets the quality standards and requirements.
-A project manager overseeing the planning, execution and delivery of software projects. They align project objectives with business goals, manage resources and mitigate risks


* Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

-Integrated development environment (IDE) helps programmers develop software code efficiently. 
It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application. e.g Visual Studio.

-Version control systems streamline development processes, enabling faster iteration and delivery of features. 
Efficient branching and merging capabilities allow developers to work concurrently on various aspects of a project without interference, significantly reducing the time from development to deployment. e.g GitLab


* What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Growing Customer Demands.
Time Constraints.
Limited Infrastructure.
Software Testing Conflicts. 
Changing Requirements.
Limited Time and Resources.
Rapid Tecnology advancement.


Step 1 – Define the problem. You have to first start with problem identification.
Step 2 – Analyze the problem. Now it's time to carry out problem analysis. 
Step 3 – Brainstorm. 
Step 4 – Make a decision. 
Step 5 – Implement.
Step 6 – Evaluate.


* Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

The 4 levels of testing in software testing are: Unit (test) for single code, Integration (test) for modules, System (test) for overall functions, 
and Acceptance (test) for user feedback. Software testing plays a critical role in ensuring software quality.


Part 2: 

* Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


* Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt, It helps mitigate bias.

It enhances the user-AI interaction so the AI understands the user's intention even with minimal input.
It also helps to improved efficiency, accuracy, and personalization.



* Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

An unclear, nonconcise statement.

Be specific, clear, and concise as much as you can about what you want to achieve.
